# Final Project Proposal

My proposal for the final project is to make a snake like game. Snake is a game where the player is a snake. The snake is constantly moving and initially is very small, but as the snake picks up stuff in the game the snake becomes longer. The player loses if you the snake runs into itself or if it runs into the wall. My variant that I hope to make is “snake like” because instead of of a snake that gets longer, it's going to be a car that leaves a constant trail. The game is going to be local multiplayer with 2 players where the player that makes the other player run into their trail wins. Along with this there is going to a boost method that the player can use to give themselves a temporary speed boost.

## My mockup of the project: 
![Game mockup](https://github.com/bribrah/Java-Final-Project/raw/master/Mockup.png)

The goal of the game is to make the other play run into a trail. You lose if you run into ANY trail, not just the other players.  The game will be controlled with the right and left keys for the right player and W and A for the left player. . When the the left(or S) key is pressed, the player will rotate 90 degrees to the left and vice verse for the left (D) key. It will likely have some sort of main menu and maybe even a car/trail color selector for each player.

## Timeline:

### Week 1

Begin planning for project, including making mockup

Begin working on basic GUI of game

### Week 2

Finish basic GUI

Begin writing classes for cars, game board, and trails.

Begin working on event handling/game logic

### Week 3

Finish classes

Continue working on event handling

Start work on gui of main game screen

### Week 4

Finish game logic

Finish main menu

Debug/test

If time, add player selection screen/gui to choose trail color and car

In the long term if the project is successful, I hope to make an android app game that has multiplayer over network functionality.
